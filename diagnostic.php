It is the examination of any part of body for diagnostic purposes by means of x-rays, the record of the findings being impressed upon a photographic plate or film.<br /><br />

X – rays: X-rays are a form of radiation, like light or radio waves that can be focused into a beam, much like a flashlight beam. Unlike a beam of light, however, X –rays can pass through most objects, including the human body. When X-rays strike a piece of photographic film, they can produce a picture. Dense tissues in the body, such as bones, block (absorb) many of the X-rays and appear white on an X-ray picture. Less dense tissues, such as muscles and organs, block fewer of the X-rays (more of the X-rays pass through) and appear in shades of gray. X-rays that pass through air appear black.<br /><br />

X –ray is one of the fastest and easiest ways for a physician to view the internal organs and structures of the body. X-Ray is an excellent tool for assessing skeletal trauma (eg. Broken bones), for diagnosing the gastro-intestinal system (digestive tract) and for comprehensive imaging of the thoracic cavity including the lungs and heart.<br /><br />

 A Doppler ultrasound test uses reflected sound waves to evaluate blood as it flows through a blood vessel. It helps doctors evaluate blood flow through the major arteries and veins of the arms, legs, and neck. It can show blocked or reduced blood flow in the arteries of the neck that could cause a stroke. It can also reveal blood clots in leg veins that could break loose and block blood flow to the lungs (pulmonary embolism).<br /><br />

Colour Doppler can determine and display the direction and velocity of blood flow in the heart chambers and vessels. This equipment in the Hope clinic is used for Doppler ultrasound, echocardiography as well as for abdominal ultrasonography.<br /><br />

This test is done by a doctor who specializes in performing and understanding imaging tests (radiologist/sonologist) or by an ultrasound technologist.<br /><br />

  A natural electrical system causes the heart muscle to contract and pump blood through the heart to the lungs and the rest of the body. Electrocardiography (ECG) is a test that records the electrical activity of the heart.<br /><br />

The electrical activity of the heart can be detected through the skin by small metal discs called electrodes. During electrocardiography, the electrodes are attached to the skin on the chest, arms, and legs. The electrodes are also connected to a machine that translates the electrical activity into line tracings on paper. These tracings are often analyzed by the machine and then carefully reviewed by a doctor for abnormalities.<br /><br />
  An electrocardiogram may show:<br /><br />
	<img src="images/arrow.png" />Evidence of heart enlargement.<br />
    <img src="images/arrow.png" />Signs of insufficient blood flow to the heart.<br />
    <img src="images/arrow.png" /> Signs of a new or previous injury to the heart (heart attack).<br />
    <img src="images/arrow.png" />Heart rhythm problems (arrhythmias)<br />
    <img src="images/arrow.png" />Changes in the electrical activity of the heart caused by a chemical (electrolyte) imbalance in the body.<br /><br />
	Electrocardiography (ECG) is usually done by a technician, and the resulting ECG is interpreted by a doctor who specializes in heart problems (Cardiologist) or a general physician.

 Stress Echocardiography or Tread Mill Test helps to evaluate how the heart responds to the demands of physical activity and can detect some early changes, which may not be seen in the resting ECG.<br /><br />
Stress Echocardiography /TMT is done:<br /><br />
	<img src="images/arrow.png" />To evaluate unexplained but stable chest pain and determine its cause when Coronary Artery diseases is suspected.<br />
	<img src="images/arrow.png" />To determine the severity of heart disease and the ability of the heart to tolerate exercise in people with known heart disease or those who have had a heart attack or heart surgery. On the basis of this information, a cardiac rehabilitation program, including appropriate exercise as well as a plan for low-risk daily physical activities, can be developed.<br />
	<img src="images/arrow.png" />To identify abnormal heart rhythms when symptoms such as dizziness, fainting, or palpitations occur during exercise or activity.<br />

 The chest X-ray is the most common type of X-ray test. Routinely taken from the back to the front, it can reveal certain abnormalities, which cannot be detected during physical examination. It provides a picture of organs and structures within the chest, including the heart and lungs, the blood vessels associated with them, and the thin sheet of muscle just below the lungs.<br /><br />
A chest X-ray can help detect problems with these structures and with the bones inside the chest, such as the ribs, clavicle (collarbone) and upper part of the spine.<br /><br />
A Chest X-ray is taken by a radiology technologist (radiographer). The X-ray pictures are usually interpreted by a doctor who specializes in evaluating X-ray (radiologist)<br /><br />
